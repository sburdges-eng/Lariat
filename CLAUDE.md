# CLAUDE.md — Lariat

Claude Code guidance for the Lariat restaurant F&B operations platform. See `AGENTS.md` for the
shared multi-tool ruleset (worktrees, MACP, trio orchestration) and `docs/` for architecture.

## Git Workflow

- Never push directly to `main`. Always create a `feat/` branch (or `fix/`/`chore/`/`wip/` per
  `AGENTS.md`) and open a PR for review.
- Verify the working directory is the canonical Lariat repo (`~/Dev/hospitality/Lariat`) before
  making any edits — not an iCloud-synced copy or a stale checkout.

## Verification / Pre-commit

- Run all verification gates — schema check, typecheck, lint, and the relevant tests — before
  committing or merging any PR. Do not commit if any gate fails.

## Tooling Conventions

- Always use the Read tool to read files before editing. Never read source via Bash (`cat`/`head`/
  `sed`) when you intend to edit it — Edit operations fail on Bash-read files.

## Environment Limitations

- Do not run interactive/TTY-dependent commands (`codex resume`, `hermes model`, browser OAuth
  flows) in the sandbox. They cannot complete in the non-interactive tool environment — flag them
  for the user to run manually instead.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **Lariat** (14336 symbols, 25665 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? `npx gitnexus analyze` (npm 11 crash → `npm i -g gitnexus`; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows. For regression review, compare against the default branch: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
